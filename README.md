# Nightwach.js Demo

Demonstrates how to automate browser testing using Nightwatch.js. This
particular demo shows how to use page objects to assign names to pages,

conjunction with BDD-style expectations to ensures that
[lansing.codes](https://www.lansing.codes) shows at least one link to a
Meetup.
